=== Installing console:
 IPython by default runs in a terminal window, but the normal terminal application supplied
 by Microsoft Windows is very primitive. 
 You may want to download the excellent and free Console[1] application instead, which is a far 
 superior tool. 
 You can even configure Console to give you by default an IPython tab, which is very convenient 
 to create new IPython sessions directly from the working terminal.
